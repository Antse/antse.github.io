<h1>Restrict access on the infrastructure using tailscale ACL's</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tailscale is a great mesh vpn with minimal setup to be able to join a private
network on top of internet.</p>
<p>One of the great feature is to use a <strong>relay[1]</strong> to forward your traffic from
your laptop to your Cloud infrastructure and only using private IP
addresses.</p>
<p>One of the drawback of this feature is that anyone on the mesh can access your
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Godd news is that we can setup <strong>ACL[2]</strong> to restrict access to people.</p>
<h2>Setup ACL's</h2>
<h3>Initial scope</h3>
<p>Let's start with 2 teams: 
<ul>
<li>Developers folks</li>
<li>Platform guys</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The Platform guys need to have access all part of the infrastructure.
The Developers folks need only to read some data on staging Databases.</p>
<p>Let's assume that Staging Databases are located on a dedicated subnet:
<code>10.0.42.0/24</code></p>
<h3>Use tags and acl</h3>
<p>There is a file defining the global access policy to tailscale, it's a big JSON
file.</p>
<p>the simplest way to implement our scope policy is to define 2 groups : </p>
<ul>
<li>platform</li>
<li>developer</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&quot;groups&quot;: {
		&quot;group:platform&quot;: [
			&quot;jean@corp.com&quot;,
			&quot;paulette@corp.com&quot;,
		],
		&quot;group:developer&quot;: [
			&quot;pierre@corp.com&quot;,
			&quot;rachel@corp.com&quot;,
		],
	},
</code></pre>
