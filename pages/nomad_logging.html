<h1>Ship logs from Nomad workload to Datadog</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>One common task to achieve during the build of a platform is to
have logs ship to a central place where they can be searchable.</p>
<p>In modern architectures, most of the workloads are isolated from each others, so this is 
not an easy task to send application logs for several reasons : 
<ul>
<li>Containers are by design isolated</li>
<li>On a Nomad cluster, you can run others tasks such as <strong>java</strong>, <strong>firecracker</strong> VMs, and so.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>There are several ways to ship log from a Nomad workload to Datadog.
I will highlight only one, a <strong>sidecar task</strong>.</p>
<p>In Nomad, task groups are sharing a common file system for each allocations running.
have logs ship to a central place where they can be searchable.</p>

<p>The application need to be configured to log in the allocation storage.</p>
<p>This is an example of sending logs from an application : </p>
<p><code>
config :logger, :error_log, 
    path: &quot;/alloc/data/info.log&quot;,
    level: :debug
</code>
